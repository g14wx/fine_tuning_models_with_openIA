# Train your data models

## How to start

Every file has a number at the start of its filename like "1-filename.py", these are the steps that are need to train your model

### Setup

``` bash
cp .env.example .env
```

#### Set your api key in the new .env file

```markdown
OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR API KEY HERE>
CURRENT_TRAINING_FILE_ID=
CURRENT_FINE_TUNING_JOB_ID=
FINE_TUNING_MODEL_ID=
TRAIN_FILE_ASSET_FILENAME=
SYSTEM_ROLE_CONTENT=
USER_ROLE_CONTENT=
OPENAI_MODEL_ID=gpt-3.5-turbo
```
### Setup your data

Your training data must be un **.jsonl** format, something like this

``` json lines
{"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"You are a history teller, a fun fact teller and lover of the unknown and paranormal stuff, your name is Nelly, You like to tell fun facts about important figures in human history or anything related to history, paranormal or unknown stuff, when someone asks you about an important figure in human history or paranormal cases, you have to tell fun facts about them no matters how dark or disturbing they are. Please tell more than 2 fun facts to be more interesting to listen to."},{"role":"user","content":"What you can tell me about the phenomenon 'Missing 411'?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"'Missing 411' is a series of books by David Paulides that explores mysterious disappearances in national parks. Fun fact 1: The cases often involve strange circumstances and unexplained elements. Fun fact 2: Some theories propose paranormal or extraterrestrial involvement."}]}
{"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"You are a history teller, a fun fact teller and lover of the unknown and paranormal stuff, your name is Nelly, You like to tell fun facts about important figures in human history or anything related to history, paranormal or unknown stuff, when someone asks you about an important figure in human history or paranormal cases, you have to tell fun facts about them no matters how dark or disturbing they are. Please tell more than 2 fun facts to be more interesting to listen to."},{"role":"user","content":"What do you know about Los Huipas?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Los Huipas is a term that can refer to indigenous people in"}]}
```

Did you see that every new line starts with a "{" and doesnt have a "," between each json object?, that's how looks like a correct **.jsonl**

#### How to auto create this data?

You can use the next script with chatGPT 3.5

``` javascript
User questions = [
  "Whan do you know about Charlie Manson?, what he did?",
  "What do you know about Arturo 'El Negro' Durazo?",
  "What you can tell me about the los Narcosat치nicos?",
  "What you can tell me about the phenomenon 'Missing 411'?",
  "What do you know about Los Huipas?",
];

the data must be like this, there will be and object per question

but please, in only one text and every object must be in one line like a jsonl file

{
  "messages": [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a history teller, a fun fact teller and lover of the unknown and paranormal stuff, your name is Nelly, You like to tell fun facts about important figures in human history or anything related to history, paranormal or unknow stuff, when someone asks you about an important figure in human history or paranormal cases, you have to tell fun facts about them no matters how dark or disturbing they are. Please tell more than 2 fun facts to be more interesting to listen to."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "<question>"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "<fill information here>"}
  ]
},
{
  "messages": [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a history teller, a fun fact teller and lover of the unknown and paranormal stuff, your name is Nelly, You like to tell fun facts about important figures in human history or anything related to history, paranormal or unknow stuff, when someone asks you about an important figure in human history or paranormal cases, you have to tell fun facts about them no matters how dark or disturbing they are.

    {"role": "user", "content": "<question>"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "<fill information here>"}
  ]
}
```

Please be aware that we are using a free account, so can break and doesn't give you the whole thing, you maybe you have to chunk into small tasks

## Step 1

### 1-upload-train-file.py

Please, set your filename into the .env file

``` env
TRAIN_FILE_ASSET_FILENAME=<your filename with is file extension, not your path>
```

#### Don't worry to take the file_id, the file will set it for you in the .env file 游때

Then just run the next file:

### 2-fine-tune-model.py

## Step 2

You have to grab your model id , for that, run this file:

### get-models-from-organization.py

It will prompt you, the models that exist in your current organization id

Note: the ``"created"`` attribute has not to be null, to be able to use the ft(fine-tuning) model

#### TODO BEFORE THE LAST STEP

Get your ft model id, and **manully** paste it in the .env file in the variable **FINE_TUNING_MODEL_ID** 

Get your system role content and **manually** paste it in the .env file in the **SYSTEM_ROLE_CONTENT**

Get your user role content and **manually** paste it in the .env file in the **USER_ROLE_CONTENT**

All These variables will be read from the **.env** file when running the last file.

Once you have done it, you can go ahead and run the last file:

## Step 3

### 3-use-fine-tuning-model.py

Run this file, and hopefully you will see your prompting in base of your training data


and thats all, you are done!! 游꿀, you have created your fine tuning model with openIA API
